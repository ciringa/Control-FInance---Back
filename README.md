## Credits ðŸ˜Ž
this is a control finance project made by me and my partner 
frontEnd features, including the page design and menu work are completly made by my friend: 
<a href = "https://github.com/ismael-henrique-dev">Ismael Henrique</a>
check: <a href = "https://github.com/ismael-henrique-dev/Control-Finance---Front-End">Control Finance FrontEnd</a>

all the backEnd features like the login/singup and database storage are made by me using firebase API from google <br>
data <a href="https://ciringa.github.io/Control-FInance---Back/">this file link</a>
## current features 
<ul>
    <li>login and singup</li>
    <li>addiction of transactions</li>
    <li>transaction manipulation by type</li>
</ul>

## roadmap
<ul>
    <li>user email verification</li>
    <li>key validation </li>
    <li>delete transactions function</li>
</ul>


## config with firebase api
firebase API is getting imported and configurated in <a>services/firebase.config</a> from line 6 to 16 

## singUP with firebase APi
using the config of previus mention, we can create accounts. currently this system is working in <a>components/pages/sinUP.jsx</a>
the system uses the form to update and control the variables in a form who creates an object used to singIn the user

when singIn the page changes the url path to Home
## more about login 
talking a little

## home control routine

if the user isin't logged yet firebase will automaticaly redirect to login screen to prevent loading erros

if the user is logged the code will search trought all the database trying to find the user transactions. it will select the transactions who matches with the user.uid variable 

inside the database each transaction has these values:
    
    type: "exemple"
    value: 9999
    user:
        uid:
        name: 

after selecting all the transactions who matches with the currentUser.uid the code will display these values on screen and also gives us a sum of these values(currently isin't working)
the main page gives us the option to filter trought three options:
Entrada - money entry
Saida - money exit
Todas - all the kinds of transactions 

## about transactions
transactions are monetary display separeted in two diferent <strong>types</strong>
the backEnd code will interacts with the database to display a frontEnd table of contents showing us all the currently monetary transactions that the account has 

under the database the transactions looks like something like this :

    type: "exemple"
    value: 9999
    user:
        uid:
        name: 

<strong>type</strong> : self explains, its the type of transaction, and entry is a + R$ and an exit is a -R$ (all the values in BRL)
<strong>value</strong>: R$ numeric values in (BRL), float values that can be negative or positive(by type)
<strong>user</strong>: an object containing two main infos, the user uid is the main info here and its used to separate each transaction from each user
the <strong>uid</strong> is our main key in the code. when the user creates an new transactions it set uid as its own uid 
the <strong>Name</strong> value is useles(only is added for some kind of verification)
